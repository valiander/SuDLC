Overview

The purpose of this document is to serve as an answer to why and how we use self-service philosophy to enhance the capabilities of internal departments (and external when available).

Why Self-Service Operations?
----------------------------

### Interruptions Keep Getting in the Way

Operations is one of the few areas in all of business where both planned and unplanned work co-exists by design.

On the one hand, there is engineering and project work to be done -- like delivering new platforms, spinning up new environments, working on scaling and performance, and analyzing new technologies.

On the other hand, there are the constant interruptions --- responding to incidents, scaling events, security events, customer requests, and inquiries from colleagues.

Most of the interruptions coming into Operations are time sensitive. Obviously, outages are urgent, and everyone depends on you to respond immediately. However, even the requests that someone should have seen coming --- like business and customer requests or a colleague who ran into an operational issue delivering a project - all get marked "urgent" and presented to you at the last minute, interrupting your work.

### Too Much Time Is Spent Waiting

You lose time waiting for someone to do something for you. Others lose time waiting for you to do something for them. Waiting is all too often a repetitive fact of life in Operations.

If you simply add up the time spent directly waiting, you can get to a big number. However, the cost to the organization is even more substantial if you take into account the compounding nature of delays in a complex system like a technology organization in an enterprise.

Self-Service Operations helps you eliminate waiting and delays. Easily setup self-service interfaces for any number of repetitive operational tasks and eliminate the amount of time that people spend waiting for you or you spend waiting for others.

What is Self-Service Operations?
--------------------------------

Self-Service Operations turns your operations tasks and requests into services that can be consumed on-demand (via GUI, command line, or API) by anyone who needs those operations task performed.
