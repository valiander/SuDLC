Overview
--------

Infosec's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that\
are contrary to Edquity's established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Infosec is committed to protecting Edquity's employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the property of Edquity. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations. Please review Human Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Edquity employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at Edquity. These rules are in place to protect the employee and Edquity. Inappropriate use exposes Edquity to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

Scope
-----

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices, and network resources to conduct Edquity business or interact with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by Edquity, the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at Edquity and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with Edquity\
policies and standards, and local laws and regulation.

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at Edquity, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by Edquity.

Policy

### General Use and Ownership

Edquity proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by Edquity, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of Edquity. You must ensure through legal or technical means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the Data Protection\
Standard.

You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of Edquity proprietary information.

You may access, use or share Edquity proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.

Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their supervisor or manager.

For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Edquity may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time, per Infosec's Audit Policy.

Edquity reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy.

### Security and Proprietary Information

All mobile and computing devices that connect to the internal network must comply with the Minimum Access Policy.

System level and user level passwords must comply with the Password Policy. Providing access to another individual, either deliberately or through failure to secure its access, is prohibited.

All computing devices must be secured with a password-protected screensaver with the automatic activation feature set to 10 minutes or less. You must lock the screen or log off when the device is unattended.

Postings by employees from a Edquity email address to newsgroups should contain a disclaimer stating that the opinions expressed are strictly their own and not necessarily those of Edquity, unless posting is in the course of business duties.

Employees must use extreme caution when opening e-mail attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain malware.

### Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of Edquity authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or international law while utilizing Edquity-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable use.

Blogging from Edquity's systems is also subject to monitoring.

Edquity's Confidential Information policy also applies to blogging. As such, Employees are prohibited from revealing any Edquity confidential or proprietary information, trade secrets or any other material covered by Edquity's Confidential Information policy when engaged in blogging.
