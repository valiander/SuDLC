Overview
--------

Infosec's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that\
are contrary to <Your Company>'s established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Infosec is committed to protecting <Your Company>'s employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations. Please review Human Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every <Your Company> employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at <Your Company>. These rules are in place to protect the employee and <Your Company>. Inappropriate use exposes <Your Company> to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

Scope
-----

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices, and network resources to conduct <Your Company> business or interact with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by <Your Company>, the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at <Your Company> and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with <Your Company>\

### General Use and Ownership

<Your Company> proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by <Your Company>, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of <Your Company>.

Standard.
