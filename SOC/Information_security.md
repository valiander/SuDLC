Overview
--------

Remote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our Team's productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates from networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly lower security posture than our corporate network. While these remote networks are beyond the control of <Your Company> policy, we must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for connecting to <Your Company>'s network from any host. These rules and requirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to <Your Company> from damages which may result from unauthorized use of <Your Company> resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or company confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public image, damage to critical <Your Company> internal systems, and fines or other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.

Scope
-----

This policy applies to all <Your Company> employees, contractors, vendors and agents with a <Your Company>-owned or personally-owned computer or workstation used to connect to the <Your Company> network. This policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on behalf of <Your Company>, including reading or sending email and viewing intranet web resources. This policy covers any and all technical implementations of remote access used to connect to <Your Company> networks.

Policy
------

It is the responsibility of <Your Company> employees, contractors, vendors and agents with remote access privileges to <Your Company>'s corporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given the same consideration as the user's on-site connection to <Your Company>.

General access to the Internet for recreational use through the <Your Company> network is strictly limited to <Your Company> employees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as "Authorized Users"). When accessing the <Your Company> network from a personal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing access to any <Your Company> computer resources or data by non-Authorized Users. Performance of illegal activities through the <Your Company> network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is prohibited.

The Authorized User bears responsibility for and consequences of misuse of the Authorized User's access. For further information and definitions, see the Acceptable Use Policy. Authorized Users will not use <Your Company> networks to access the Internet for outside business interests.

### Requirements

Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases. For further information see the Acceptable Encryption Policy and the Password Policy.

Authorized Users shall protect their login and password, even from family members.

While using a <Your Company>-owned computer to remotely connect to <Your Company>'s corporate network, Authorized Users shall ensure the remote host is not connected to any other network at the same time, with the exception of personal networks that are under their complete control or under the complete control of an Authorized User or Third Party.

Use of external resources to conduct <Your Company> business must be approved in advance by InfoSec and the appropriate business unit manager.

All hosts that are connected to <Your Company> internal networks via remote access technologies must use the most up-to-date anti-virus software (place url to corporate software site here), this includes personal computers. Third party connections must comply with requirements as stated in the Third Party Agreement.
